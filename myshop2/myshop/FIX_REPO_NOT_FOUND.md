# Fix "Repository not found" Error

## 🔍 Why This Happens

"Repository not found" means either:
1. **Repository doesn't exist yet** on GitHub
2. **Authentication issue** (wrong credentials)
3. **Wrong repository URL**

---

## ✅ Solution

### Step 1: Verify Repository Exists

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend
2. **Check:** Does the page load? Or does it say "404 Not Found"?

**If 404 (doesn't exist):**
- You need to create it first on GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Create the repository

**If it exists:**
- It's an authentication issue (see Step 2)

---

### Step 2: Fix Authentication

GitHub requires a **Personal Access Token** (not password).

#### Create Personal Access Token:

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. **Click:** "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. **Name:** "Render Deployment"
4. **Expiration:** 90 days (or No expiration)
5. **Select scope:** Check `repo` (full control of private repositories)
6. **Click:** "Generate token"
7. **IMPORTANT:** Copy the token immediately! (You won't see it again)

#### Use Token When Pushing:

When you run `git push`, it will ask for:
- **Username:** `hesamsaeedi55`
- **Password:** Paste your **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password!)

---

### Step 3: Try Push Again

```bash
cd "/Users/hesamoddinsaeedi/Desktop/best/backup copy 64/myshop2/myshop"
git push -u origin IOS
```

When prompted:
- **Username:** `hesamsaeedi55`
- **Password:** Your Personal Access Token

---

## 🎯 Alternative: Use SSH (Easier)

If you have SSH keys set up, use SSH URL instead:

```bash
# Remove HTTPS remote
git remote remove origin

# Add SSH remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend.git

# Push
git push -u origin IOS
```

## ✅ Quick Checklist

- [ ] Repository exists on GitHub? (Check: https://github.com/hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend)
- [ ] Created Personal Access Token?
- [ ] Using token as password (not GitHub password)?
- [ ] Repository URL is correct?

---

## 🚀 After Push Succeeds

1. Go to Render.com
2. Connect to `hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend`
3. Deploy!

**Most likely issue:** Need to create Personal Access Token and use it as password!
