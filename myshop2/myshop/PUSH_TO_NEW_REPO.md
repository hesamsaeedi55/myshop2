# Push to New GitHub Repo - Step by Step

## ✅ Best Way: Push Existing Repository

Since you already have all files committed locally, use **"push an existing repository"** option.

---

## 🚀 Commands to Run

### Step 1: Remove Old Remote (if exists)
```bash
cd "/Users/hesamoddinsaeedi/Desktop/best/backup copy 64/myshop2/myshop"
git remote remove origin
```

### Step 2: Add New Remote
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend.git
```

### Step 3: Push to New Repo
```bash
# Your branch is "IOS", so push to IOS:
git push -u origin IOS
```

**OR** if you want to use "main" branch:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

If it asks for credentials:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)

### How to Create Personal Access Token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click: "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "Render Deployment"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control)
5. Click: "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you'll only see it once!)
7. Use this token as password when pushing

---

## ✅ After Push

Your files will be on GitHub, then you can:
1. Go to Render.com
2. Connect to `hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend`
3. Deploy!

---

## 🎯 Quick Summary

```bash
cd "/Users/hesamoddinsaeedi/Desktop/best/backup copy 64/myshop2/myshop"
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/hesamsaeedi55/myshop-backend.git
git push -u origin IOS
```

**If authentication fails:** Create Personal Access Token and use it as password.
